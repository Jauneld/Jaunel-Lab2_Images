      <p>Hello. My name is Jaunel. I am intelligent and adventurous. I have short black hair and I am fourteen.I attend the high school Thomas A. Edison CTE. I love to bake and read webtoons. My favorite music artists are Panic! at the Disco, Fall Out Boys, blackbear and Missio. My favorite color is aqua. Even though I don't talk to people much, I love group work and socailizing with people in a small group. The reason why I joined Web Development is because I thought that it would be cool to create apps and websites that people could use for generations. I want to make an impact using technology which is where the world is going.</p>
